It is meant for ongoing 1-1 meetings, progress reviews, and major research milestones. 1. Project Overview Project Lead: Guanqiao Feng Team Members: Sisira Kadambat Nair Matthew Boccalon Michael Tran Project Start Date: Jan 15 2025 Target End Date: Dec 15 2026 Summary (3\u20135 sentences): With the rapid expansion of pharmacogenomics datasets in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, inconsistencies in data curation, storage, and analysis workflows hinder reproducibility and data reuse. This project deploys the open-source Xeva R/Bioconductor framework and XevaDB web platform to provide standardized, FAIR-compliant pharmacogenomics infrastructure for PDX model management and analysis, enabling scalable drug-response profiling and mechanistic discovery. 2. Annual Goals (High-Level) List 3\u20136 major goals for the year. These should align with lab objectives, grants, and upcoming conference/manuscript opportunities. Goal 1: Publication of XevaDB manuscript. Goal 2: Grant application for ModelDB (combined database for PDX and PDO)? Goal 3: Conference? 3.
