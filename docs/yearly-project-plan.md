## 1. Project Overview  
**Project Lead:** 

- Guanqiao Feng 

**Team Members:**  

- Sisira Kadambat Nair

- Matthew Boccalon

- Michael Tran

**Project Start Date:**  

- Jan 15 2025

**Target End Date:**  

- Dec 15 2026

**Summary (3–5 sentences):**  

- With the rapid expansion of pharmacogenomics datasets in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, inconsistencies in data curation, storage, and analysis workflows hinder reproducibility and data reuse. This project deploys the open-source Xeva R/Bioconductor framework and XevaDB web platform to provide standardized, FAIR-compliant pharmacogenomics infrastructure for PDX model management and analysis, enabling scalable drug-response profiling and mechanistic discovery.

## 2. Annual Goals (High-Level)

List 3–6 major goals for the year. These should align with lab objectives, grants, and upcoming conference/manuscript opportunities.

- Goal 1: Publication of XevaDB manuscript. 
- Goal 2: Grant application for ModelDB (combined database for PDX and PDO)? 
- Goal 3: Conference?
